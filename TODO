-Fixed? Seek needs improvements for crossing track boundaries:
          * Seek past end of track ignores random mode and repeat track mode.  
          * Seek past of end of last track generates an assertion failure.  

-Fixed? Intro mode does not observe repeat disc mode.  

-Fixed? When CD player plays entire disk, track should reset to 1.  

-Fixed? Ejecting a CD while player is running causes player to crash.

Possibly use FXThreadEx to get cd info in background.  

Changing icon colors will usually require a restart of the app.  Each icon
should each have a mask indicating which places to recolor.  This will fix the problem.  Currently the problem is due to colors being slightly different after being restored from a pixmap.  

When drive door is closed manually with no disc in the tray the cd player still thinks drive door is open.  

Mute does not work.  

Increase seek speed with respect to seek length

-Done (mostly) Implement settings button and menu option.  

Toshiba DVD-ROM performs like expected but Generic CD-ROM has exhibited 2 problems:
  1.  It does not report its state as being completed when a disc plays to end.  So,
      because of this repeat album is not working here.  For some reason it reports this
      state when it starts playing, before it reports the play state.  I guess you get what you pay for.  
  2.  Ejecting when CD is playing stops the cd but does not eject.  Eject must be pressed again to make it happen.  
      gtcd and kscd als exhibit this behavior (but neither of them can ever eject the cd).  
This may not be worth worrying about.  Once, RealJukebox told me it could not record a CD because
the drive was sub-par so maybe that's the answer to give to anyone who experiences these problems.
