-Fixed? Seek needs improvements for crossing track boundaries:
          * Seek past end of track ignores random mode and repeat track mode.  
          * Seek past of end of last track generates an assertion failure.  

-Fixed? Intro mode does not observe repeat disc mode.  

-Fixed? When CD player plays entire disk, track should reset to 1.  

-Fixed? Ejecting a CD while player is running causes player to crash.

-Done! Implement settings button and menu option.  

-Done! Add advanced buttons for CDDB and CDindex settings to set cgi scripts.  

-Done! [By zeroing cd-rom volume.  This is actually how OSS mixers handle mute.]  Mute does not work.  

-Fixed? Changing colors for the mute icons (two colors each) has problems with one color becoming the transparency or both colors becoming the same.  

Batch mode for network info retrieval - will require mods to libcdaudio.  

CD device discovery

Support for audio mixers other than the cd player (OSS, ALSA, Solaris, Irix, etc)

Add submission of disc data to freedb and cdindex.  

Updates to libcdaudio:
 * Make it work on Windows!!
 * Update CDDB code to work with latest protocol levels.  

cdaudio host_addressing string retrieved from server contains additional proto level4 info

Possibly use FXThreadEx to get cd info in background.  

When drive door is closed manually with no disc in the tray the cd player still thinks drive door is open.  

Increase seek speed with respect to seek duration

Toshiba DVD-ROM performs like expected but Generic CD-ROM has exhibited 2 problems:
  1.  It does not report its state as being completed when a disc plays to end.  So,
      because of this repeat album is not working here.  For some reason it reports this
      state when it starts playing, before it reports the play state.  I guess you get what you pay for.  
  2.  Ejecting when CD is playing stops the cd but does not eject.  Eject must be pressed again to make it happen.  
      gtcd and kscd als exhibit this behavior (but neither of them can ever eject the cd).  
This may not be worth worrying about.  Once, RealJukebox told me it could not record a CD because
the drive was sub-par so maybe that's the answer to give to anyone who experiences these problems.
