  * This is a list of changes since initial (limited) release (fxcd-0.3)
  * Fixed seek problems with crossing track boundaries:
    - Seek past end of track ignores random mode and repeat track mode.  
    - Seek past of end of last track generates an assertion failure.  
  * Fixed problem where intro mode does not observe repeat disc mode.  
  * Fixed problem with CD player not reseting track after it plays entire disk.  
  * Fixed problem where ejecting a CD while player is running causes player to crash.
  * Fixed both? Toshiba DVD-ROM performs like expected but Generic CD-ROM has exhibited 2 problems:
    - Fixed with hack?  1.  It does not report its state as being completed when a disc plays to end.  So,
      because of this repeat album is not working here.  For some reason it reports this
      state when it starts playing, before it reports the play state.  I guess you get what you pay for.  
    -Fixed with hack?  2.  Ejecting when CD is playing stops the cd but does not eject.  Eject must be pressed again to make it happen.  
      gtcd and kscd als exhibit this behavior (but neither of them can ever eject the cd).  
  * Implemented settings dialog, button, and menu option.  
  * Added advanced buttons for CDDB and CDindex settings to set cgi scripts.  
  * Implemented mute (By zeroing cd-rom volume.  This is actually how OSS mixers handle mute).  
  * Fixed issue with changing colors for the mute icons (two colors each) having problems with one color becoming the transparency or both colors becoming the same.  
  * Fixed bug, when the cd player starts while a disk is already playing, the stopped flag is not properly set to FALSE.  
  * When there are multiple cddb entries, there is now a dialog to provide a choice.  
  * Now uses GNU build system (autoconf,automake,etc).
